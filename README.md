### App Idea ###
I would make a reddit-like app but only for students on my school's campus. Users can post about their classes, clubs, and other activities. Users can also comment on other posts and upvote/downvote posts. Users can also create groups for their clubs and classes.
The idea is that this would be a more organized way for students to communicate with each other and share information about their classes and clubs. It would also be a good way for students to find out about clubs and classes they might be interested in.
